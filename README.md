This is a Project to make a portable prototype of BUMP INTEGRATOR DEVICE, to measure the uneven Index value of road
or Highway surfaces based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical System Sensor GYRO MPU5060. 
It can help to measure the road Quality based on the readings obtained by placing this device on vehicle and then 
driving on the road.
